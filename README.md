# Generalized Data Structure Library (C++)

## 📌 Overview
A generalized data structure library implemented in C++, providing reusable and scalable implementations of various linked list variants. 
The library is data-type independent, allowing users to create multiple linked lists of different data types simultaneously.

## ✨ Features
* Supports multiple types of linked lists
* Template-based implementation (data-type independent)
* Allows creation of multiple linked list objects
* Modular and reusable design
* Easy to extend with additional data structures

## 📚 Supported Linked Lists
The library currently includes the following generalized linked list implementations:
1. Singly Linear Linked List
2. Singly Circular Linked List
3. Doubly Linear Linked List
4. Doubly Circular Linked List

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:**
    * Templates
    * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    * Dynamic Memory Management
