Generalized Data Structure Library (C++)
Overview

A generalized data structure library implemented in C++, providing reusable and scalable implementations of various linked list variants.
The library is data-type independent, allowing users to create multiple linked lists of different data types simultaneously.

** Features

Supports multiple types of linked lists

Template-based implementation (data-type independent)

Allows creation of multiple linked list objects

Modular and reusable design

Easy to extend with additional data structures

** Supported Linked Lists

The library currently includes the following generalized linked list implementations:

Singly Linear Linked List

Singly Circular Linked List

Doubly Linear Linked List

Doubly Circular Linked List

** Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts:

Templates

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Dynamic Memory Management
